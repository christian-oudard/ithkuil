consonant cluster affix notes

The clusters SQ(cook) and ZQ(slippery) cannot be written as Q(bottom=Bend), because it would be ambiguous.
They must be written as Q(diacritic=HookRight) and Q(diacritic=AngleDownRight)

for f-/v- pairs, it always seems to match voiceness with the following unvoiced/voiced plosive



notes from Paul Donnelly

The chief issues I run into when searching the Ithkuil grammar in my
browser are a lack of centralization, meaning I have to search
suffixes and roots separately, a lack of summarization, indiscriminate
searching (that is, I get random chunks of definitions when I want
glosses), duplicate results from repeated words, and a lot of
substring matches when I wanted whole words.

Most of these look easy to avoid in a dictionary design so I don't
think I need to spend time on them. Some of them, like indiscriminate
searching, could actually be assets if the results were organized
better. Substring matches would probably not be an issue if the
results were organized better, and if matches in glosses were listed
first.

Since there's not much to say about the above, I'll move on to how I
think a dictionary should work for optimal use. Ithkuil expresses so
much through its morphology that I think a dictionary should contain
more than just roots and stems--suffixes and cases could also be
included to good effect. Looking to the future, if it were possible to
include whole words, this would probably prove useful, but I think a
well-designed program could fairly easily be modular enough to add
whole words and any other kind of record at a later date. Roots,
stems, suffixes, and cases are of primary importance.

I also think it's vital that a dictionary be user-editable, at least
by users with some kind of account. Dictionary development is such a
big job that it needs every hand it can get. On that subject, below I
propose quite a few data fields that could probably not be populated
mechanically. Personally, I think it's okay to start out with a lot of
blank spaces, and only the core data filled in. Better to have spaces
to fill than to find a very helpful feature is missing.

I think the best user interface for a dictionary is the one that does
the most with the least user input, to wit, a search box and a
well-organized result list and listing format. Accordingly, diagrams
of the UI will show what features are useful.

Example search results, drawn from manually searching for "light" on
the relevant pages of ithkuil.net:

________________________________________________________________________
Search for: [..light......] Search!

In gloss:
-k'- light/radiant energy

In definition:
-kç FRC Degree of Physical Force Exerted (4 matches)
D1 too light(ly)/too soft(ly)/too delicate(ly)
D2 light as a feather/baby soft; extremely delicately or lightly or...

-kss- hadrons (composite fermions or composite bosons)

Perhaps this isn't the best layout, but something like it, drawing
from all the information in the dictionary would be good. I think it's
important to sort results by the field they occur in and the
"top-level" (that is, stem, suffix, or case) listing they occur under,
or you could drown in results. But at the same time, it's good to see
in the results list which specific matches you have.

"In gloss" is the list of listings which have matches in their gloss
words (it's assumed that each entry has a list of gloss words, except
possibly some cases which are hard to gloss, or those words that
nobody has glossed yet).

"In definition" lists matches in definitions, sorted by the root or
suffix they occur under, with the specific stems or degrees they occur
in listed (probably not in full, you'll see "-kç" only lists 2 of 4
matches).

"In SSD" refers to matches for stem specific derivatives made with the
SSD suffix. It's assumed that each stem listing has a space storing
its stem specific derivatives, if any.

"In example" lists matches in the example sentences for the
listing. It's assumed that several types of listings have a space
where example sentences, in Ithkuil and their translations to the
dictionary language, can be stored. Here, there are no translations,
because ithkuil.net doesn't provide any.

I also assume listings have space provided for notes people might want
to include, and tags for categorization (e.g. "feelings" or
"animals"), but in this search, there were no matches in these fields.

Then, there would also be a page to view a specific dictionary
listing, be that a root, stem, suffix, or case. Stems should probably
be listed on their root's page.

At the very top you see an ASCII-art depiction of a rendering of the
character for the root, which is obviously non-critical but would be
very nice to have, in my opinion. And perhaps not so much work since
you already have written code to render characters. Below that is the
root's romanization, and its glosses. If it was patterned after
another root, that would be listed here. Tags follow.

After this is a table presenting information about the stems. There
are a lot of ways this could be done, all with different
advantages. I'll look at this in a moment.

Next comes any notes there might be for this root, in this case there
are some example derivatives.

After that would be any example sentences. I wouldn't expect many of
these for roots, although there might be some for many of the cases,
since they're provided on the case morphology page and translating the
English examples would be a fun project.

Now, the question of how to list stems comes up. I think the spatial
arrangement used in the lexicon has advantages especially as a
mnemonic for which stem means what, but on the other hand I find it
very easy to get lost in the table, especially between the
formal/informal side. If the headings for patterns 1, 2, and 3 were
changed to include those numbers and names, I think it would be
easier. I also think that putting patterns 2 and 3 above one another
so you didn't get the odd S2,S3,S2,S3 pattern on the bottom row would
be helpful, so that's how I arranged things above.

There's quite a bit of information about stems it would be good to
include and store (definition, glosses, stem-specific derivatives,
notes, and tags), but which would be awkward to fit in this
table. Perhaps the table could contain definitions only and the other
stuff could go below (especially since a lot of that information is
likely not to be provided, or to apply to only one stem, or to all
stems, thus not amounting to a lot of text). I like the idea of
listing stems as combined VrCr values, but since there are four (STA
DYN MNF DSC) for each stem I'm not sure that's practical. Just to try
it out, my mockup above lists them that way (I trimmed the definitions
just to make it more readable in ASCII).

Cases and suffixes would need a slightly different format for their
page, of course. It would be nice but not crucial if cases showed the
relevant primary and secondary characters. Cases are a little harder
to include in a dictionary, since not all of them have simple glosses,
but some can and should be (e.g. ABL: "from", "out of"; LOC: "on",
"in", "by"; LIM: "in time for"; ELP: "ago"; EXC: "except", and so
on). Plus there are a lot of cases, just like there are a lot of
suffixes and roots/stems, so some searchability would be good.

Here's an example scheme for storing dictionary information, that
illustrates what information I think would be good to store.

Root
| root            | The consonantal root itself                                                      |
| patterned_after | The root it is patterned after, if any                                           |
| glosses         | A list of English gloss words                                                    |
| notes           | A free-form block of text for notes on the root, e.g. example morph. derivatives |
| tags            | A list of tag words for free-form categorization                                 |
| stems           | Either a list of stems, or the fields required for all 18 stems                  |
| examples        | A list of example sentences                                                      |
Applying examples to roots is specific enough. Like suffixes and
degrees, a root will only ever appear in specific stems, and no one
will write examples for every stem.

Stem
| pattern    | The pattern, 1-3, that the stem belongs to                   |
| stem       | The number, 1-3, of this stem in its pattern                 |
| formal     | Whether the stem is formal or informal                       |
| definition | A free-form string giving its meaning                        |
| glosses    | A list of English gloss words                                |
| ssd        | A list of stem-specific derivatives (format defined below ?) |
| notes      | A free form block of text for notes on the stem              |
| tags       | A list of tag words for free-form categorization             |
I think both roots and stems deserve a space for notes; since these
are the most basic part of a word, they are also subject to the most
inflection and varied use. Cases need notes less than suffixes or
roots, since their definitions are more like descriptions, but I think
it's good to have a place for information about a case that isn't
officially part of its definition.

Ssd
| definitions | A list of definitions, one for each degree |

Suffix
| forms        | A list of consonantal forms for the suffix (some have 2) |
| abbreviation | The abbreviation used to refer to the suffix, e.g. "DEF" |
| name         | The name given, e.g. "Degree Of Definiteness"            |
| notes        | A block of text for notes                                |
| degrees      | Definitions for the 9 degrees of the suffix              |
| examples     | A list of example sentences                              |
I think suffix examples should apply to suffixes and not degrees. It's
not likely to be useful to have an example for every degree, and
examples are already specific to degree, since they occur in a
specific degree. I put notes here rather than in Degree because I
don't think per-degree notes are especially likely, and also because
notes are likely to apply to multiple degrees.

Degree
| definition | The definition given in the grammar  |
| glosses    | A list of glosses for a given degree |

Case
| forms        | A list of vowel forms for the case (some have 2) |
| abbreviation | The abbreviation used to refer to the case       |
| name         | The case's name                                  |
| definition   | The case's definition                            |
| glosses      | A list of glosses                                |
| examples     | A list of example sentences                      |
| notes        | A block of text for notes                        |

Example
| ithkuil     | A sentence in Ithkuil using the feature                  |
| translation | A translation to whatever language the dictionary is for |
